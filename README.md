## Limitation
- Good news!! Support only on iPad (1024x768) screen size :)) no RESPONSIVE!!

## Also, we already prepared some stuff for you!!! :D

### 1. Base project (includes iPad layout screen, so cool!!)

### 2. Service API
  - You can run service api by `yarn run api`
  - The endpoint to get Pokémon list is `[GET]http://localhost:3030/api/cards`
  - query
    - limit: default 20 item/
    - name: search monster by name
    - type: search monster by type
    - example: http://localhost:3030/api/cards?limit=30&name=picha&type=normal

### 3. How to calculate `HP level`, `Strength level`, `Weakness level` and `Happiness level`.

  - HP level calculation
      - maximum is 100. if value is higher than 100 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
  - Strength level calculation
      - use `attacks` length to multiply by 50, maximum is 100. e.g. if value is 1 set it to 50, 2 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
  - Weakness level calculation
      - use `weaknesses` length multiply by 100, maximum is 100. e.g. if value is 1 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
  - Damage calculation
      - use `damage` value without symbol of all attacks skill. e.g. 50+ set it to 50, 20* set it to 20, otherwise 0.
  - Happiness level calculation
      - ((HP / 10) + (Damage /10 ) + 10 - (Weakness)) / 5
      
  #### Example
    Pikachu {
      name: 'Pikachu',
      hp: 110,
      attacks: [
        { name: 'attack A', damage: '20+'},
        { name: 'attack B', damage: '40x'}
      ],
      weaknesses: [
        { name: 'weakness A'},
      ]
    }
  
    Output {
      hp: 100,
      strength: '100%',
      weakness: '50%',
      damage: 60,
      happiness: 5
    }
